Video Guide - [https://youtu.be/BNv4gIsXulw](https://youtu.be/BNv4gIsXulw)

Hey everyone, it’s Dan from SidehustleReliance. Earlier in the year, I did an article on the ultimate Swagbucks guide, but recently the platform has announced several changes. In this article, I’ll be providing you with an update on these Swagbucks Changes as of June 2022 which were recently announced. I’ll also be looking into it further and weighing up in the platform is still worthwhile to use. As well as discussing a new exciting way to earn.

**Watch Links Removed**

Firstly I think we need to look at the recent changes to the Ncrave and Watch links. To be the bringer of bad news, these have been discontinued on the Swagbucks site. Swagbucks announced that “Starting June 1st, Watch will no longer be an available activity on Swagbucks. We want to ensure that we provide the best experience for our members, and unfortunately, we were no longer able to meet that goal with Watch. Like you, we’re disappointed to make this announcement”. This is really saddening, as it could be an easy 30 – 50sb a day by just clicking certain links.

On my website, I’ve decided to leave these special links on the 2022 guide, due to the fact Swagbucks could always retract the decision, but currently, this is out of the way. Personally, I think this is a bad decision, for example, you might want to hit your daily goal, and now SB has made that unreachable for individuals who aren’t savvy with the platform.

**Coupons Changes June 2022 on Swagbucks**

Secondly, as of June 29th 2022. The coupons will be removed from the platform. This was one of the easiest ways to earn a quick 20SB daily. The platform announced that the only way to earn with coupons going forward would be using the “Magic Receipts” which sadly is only available in certain countries, such as the US, UK and Canada. Similarly to the Ncrave links and Watches, this change is dishearting. I really love the platform and I’m sad to see coupons leaving.

**New Swagbucks Earning Opportunity Swagit**

The final thing I need to discuss is the new application Swagit. This is a Tiktok clone, but this application is designed to allow users to upload content and earn Swagbucks from other users. The best thing is, you can donate SB to 5 users, and gain a minimum of 10 bonuses back. 2SB for every 1SB donated. In the past Swagbucks has done special promotions too. In these promos, you can win 2SB, 5SB, 10SB, 20SB and 100SB, per person you’ve donated to. This application is only available in the US currently. If you’re outside of those districts, you will have to either sideload the application to your android device using a third-party site. If you have trouble logging in, please uninstall the app, and repeat. You’ll eventually, you’ll manage to get in.

I actually upload content under the name “**CogginLOL**” and if you’d like, you could donate 5SB to me, and you will support my blog and YouTube and get rewarded by Swagit in return.

**Final thoughts on the Swagbucks Changes June 2022**

These are the three updates I would like to discuss but do I think Swagbucks is still worth it. Yes, I do. Even if you only do the Games, Searches and Swagcodes. You can still net yourself on average around 50 cents for minimal work. I normally do it when I’m chilling for the evening, and it’s still a fabulous earner. Swagbucks is still one of my favourite ways to earn, and one thing I’ve noticed, when one door closes, another one opens. As soon as there are any new ways to earn on the platform I’ll let you know! Thanks for watching my video, please head over to my ultimate Swagbucks guide if you’re interested in getting started.
